# jrodz-portfolio

## Description
This portfolio was created to display my work to potential employers for them to assess whether I'd be a good fit for an open position. My portfolio contains three main sections: **About Me**,**Work**, and a **Contact** section. The webpage first displays a section that contains some information about who I am and what the viewer can find in my portfolio. Next my work is displayed with the most current project I worked on being the *biggest image* in the **Work** section. Lastly the **Contact** section contains two links for potential employers to see my Github repositories and access my LinkedIn page. The portfolio also displays a responsive layout that adapts to different viewports.

## Installation 
There are no installations needed to view the portfolio. Simply click on the provided link and it will deploy my portfolio.

## Usage
When a link is clicked on in the navigation bar, the UI will scroll to the corresponding section on the webpage. The **About Me** section gives a brief description of who I am, my educational background, and what I wish to offer as a fullstack developer. 

The **Work** section contains images that when clicked on deploy the application. Each image card contains the title of the project and what the primary focus was for that specific project in the section that says *Using:*.

The **Contact Me** section contains two links, one to my Github and one to my LinkedIn. When the user clicks on either of the words, it will take them directly to the corresponding link.
